This project tests the basic operation of the library. Running it will start a
number of tests with output going to oblibtest.log and stdout. All tests should
complete successfully with failed tests indicating a problem of some sort.

The file testout.esp will be created during the tests. It can further be checked
by loading it into the Construction Set and verify its data is valid.
