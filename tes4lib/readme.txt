Tes4Lib is a library build of the sources files used to load and manipulate various
Oblivion files, such as ESP/ESM plugins.

Several things to keep in mind:
     - It is provided as is with no documentation (I have no time).
     - Its primary intent is to be used with the ObEdit plugin editor. Features and
       the overall design are created with this in mind.
     - It is a continual work in progress. The interface is not fixed and may (will)
       change in future versions.
     - Although tested in various ways there are no doubt bugs here and there.
     - It is built and intended for use in MS Visual C++ v6.0. It may require some
       modifications to work under other compilers. I've done some trial builds with
       GCC and while most compiles there still remains some issues.
     - To use, simply extract somewhere useful and include the Tes4lib.h and Tes4lib.lib
       files in your project.
     - Source code is freely available at http://tes4lib.sf.net/
